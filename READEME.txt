1.'git init' -> powers your folder to be managed by git, and initialises 
a new empty repository. It also create a .git folder that has all the 
relevant logic to manage version of your project.

2. 'Working Area '-> There can be bunch of files that are not currently handled by the git.
It means that changes done or to be done in these files are not managed by git yet. A file 
which is in working area is considered to be in the staging area. When we do 'git status'
and we see a bunch if 'untracked files' then these are actually called to be in the working area.

3. 'staging Area' -> What all fies are going to be part of the next version that we will create.
This staging area is the place where git knows what changes will be done from the last version to
the next version.

4. 'Repository Area' -> This area actually contains the details of all you previous registered version.
And the files in the area, git already manages them and knows their version history.

5. 'git add <files>' -> moves file from working area to staging area

6. 'git rm --cached <file>' -> moves file back from staging area to working area

7. 'commit' -> Commit is a particular version of the project. It captures a snapshot of the project's staged 
changes and create a version out of it.

8. 'git commit' -> registers staging to a commit
